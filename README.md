## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

# JAVA01
Task : Make a Guess a Number With the help of JAVA
# 🎲 Guess the Number Game (Java)

Welcome to **Guess the Number**, a simple Java-based terminal game where your task is to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.
- You keep guessing until you find the correct number.
- After each guess, the program tells you whether your guess is **too high** or **too low**.
- Once you guess correctly, it tells you how many attempts you took.

---

## 💻 Technologies Used

- Java
- Scanner (for user input)
- Random (for number generation)

---

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Make sure you have **Java installed** on your system.

2. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   javac GuessTheNumber.java
